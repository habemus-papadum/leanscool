To get started, N suggested they formalize and prove two theorems in lean4: One "easy" and the other "hard."

D selected the following two choices:
- Easy: Prove that the sum of the first `n` natural numbers  is `n*(n+1)/2`.
- Hard: Prove that the estimator that minimizes the residual sum of squares `||y - xB||^2` is `(x^Tx)^-1 x^Ty`
