# task_000

### Diary
- Thrashed around for few hours on sum of first n

- Retreated back to basics and worked on completing Natural Numbers Game
  - took ~10 hours to beat all worlds, somewhat humbling...
    - I had hoped it would be easier: I had read ~3-4 chapters of MoP, MiL, and TPiL, FPiL, watch videos, read a few papers but did not operationalize what I was reading
    - but at least I did it
  - ~ halfway through Set Game
  - Have not started on Logic Game
  - Definitely need to return to this game a few more times -- despite solving it, many times I felt like in was in a fugue state.  Do not feel like I could explain to someone might thought process. 

- Returned to sum of first n -- was able to solve! (see `task_000/Basic.lean`)    

### Future Tasks
- Blueprint-ify sum of first n
- Mechanics of Proof -- do exercises!!!
- Finish Set and Logic games
- Task_000, part 2?
- Other proofs: exact formula for fibonacci
- MiL -- read and do exercises
- FPiL 
  - rayrtacer? raytracing language
  - dependency graph for defs and theorems in Mathlib
