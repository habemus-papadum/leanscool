Problem: Prove that the sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n+1)/2

THRASHING (skip to section below for final solution)


Diary of my first attempt at solving this problem.  Mostly explored how to formalize the statment
and then tried seeing if `aesop` would magically prove it for me.

Realize I don't really know the syntax of lean 4 very well by memory -- I have just been reading .
I decided to see how easy it would be to use Claude to help me understand how to do various things in Lean 4

The first thing I asked it was how to do block comments in lean 4. Unfortunately, instead of using the word 'comments',
I use the word 'quotes' and it told me to use triple quotes and then showed me the block comment syntax for Lean4  anyway.
 But, it showed me the notation for documentation style block comments (/-- -/) which ended up creating an error when there was no definiton
 following the block comment, which took me a second to figure out.
-/

/-
Then I asked it to show me the notation for a summation in lean 4.

It gave me an import that didn't work. I assume it's been refactored to something else. But it did show me several ways of expressing a summation
-/
#check ∑ x in {1, 2, 3} , x

/-
from here I think I should be able to progress from memory based on what I have been reading in the Lean 4 documentation.
(Reality check:  I should probably read the documentation more carefully; absolutely could not proceed by memory)

-- Note: The below is incorrect; I fix it later

It took several tries but I eventually arrived at the below formalization without having to refer back to MoP or MiL (or Claude).

SOLUTION

Desiderata:  wanted to use calc style proof for the main argument (to better understand how to use calc)

Approach:
- use induction
- base case -- simple, but copilot generated it
- inductive case -- use calc style proof
   - putting it down for a few hours and coming back helped make progress
   - but also realizing I could introduce lemmas that as needed, which is much simpler than trying to
     find the relevant premise in Mathlib
   -  so I would take reasonable steps and introduce lemmas needed for the step and then go back and prove the
      lemma later
- Lemmas proved by claude or copilot (editing / fixing was always required)

Thanks, how about how to prove a/2 + b/2 = (a+b)/2 for naturals a and b

For natural numbers, this isn't always true without additional conditions! Let me show you a counterexample and then how to prove it with the right conditions:

```lean
https://claude.site/artifacts/afb823da-4fcd-4970-8031-f96bcb461700

import Mathlib.Data.Nat.Basic
import Mathlib.Algebra.Ring.Basic

-- First, let's prove it's not always true with a counterexample
example : ∃ a b : ℕ, a/2 + b/2 ≠ (a + b)/2 := by
  use 1, 1
  -- When a = b = 1:
  -- 1/2 + 1/2 = 0 + 0 = 0
  -- (1 + 1)/2 = 2/2 = 1
  simp only [Nat.one_div_two, Nat.add_div_two]
  norm_num

-- Now let's prove it when both numbers are even
theorem div_two_add_even (a b : ℕ) (ha : 2 ∣ a) (hb : 2 ∣ b) :
    a/2 + b/2 = (a + b)/2 := by
  -- Get the numbers that a and b are double of
  rcases ha with ⟨k, hk⟩
  rcases hb with ⟨m, hm⟩
  -- Substitute a = 2k and b = 2m
  rw [hk, hm]
  -- Now we have (2k)/2 + (2m)/2 = (2k + 2m)/2
  repeat rw [Nat.mul_div_cancel_left _ two_pos]
  -- Simplify right side
  rw [← mul_two, Nat.mul_div_cancel_left _ two_pos]

-- We can also prove it when the sum is even
theorem div_two_add_sum_even (a b : ℕ) (h : 2 ∣ (a + b)) :
    a/2 + b/2 = (a + b)/2 := by
  -- We'll prove this by showing both sides multiplied by 2 are equal
  apply Nat.div_eq_div (two_pos)
  · exact two_pos
  · -- Show 2(a/2 + b/2) = a + b
    rw [mul_add]
    repeat rw [Nat.mul_div_le]
    -- The key is that we know a + b = 2k for some k
    rcases h with ⟨k, hk⟩
    rw [hk]
    -- Use properties of division
    rw [two_mul]
    exact le_antisymm
      (Nat.add_le_add (Nat.mul_div_le _ _) (Nat.mul_div_le _ _))
      (by rw [← hk]; exact le_refl _)

-- Equivalence theorem showing these are the only cases where it works
theorem div_two_add_iff (a b : ℕ) :
    a/2 + b/2 = (a + b)/2 ↔ 2 ∣ a ∨ 2 ∣ b ∨ 2 ∣ (a + b) := by
  constructor
  · intro h
    -- This direction is more complicated and requires careful case analysis
    sorry -- (proof omitted for brevity)
  · intro h
    cases h with
    | inl ha => exact div_two_add_even a b ha (by sorry)
    | inr h => cases h with
      | inl hb => exact div_two_add_even a b (by sorry) hb
      | inr hab => exact div_two_add_sum_even a b hab

```



This proof is quite interesting because it shows that for natural numbers, a/2 + b/2 = (a+b)/2 is not always true! The key points are:

It fails for a = b = 1 because:

1/2 + 1/2 = 0 + 0 = 0
(1 + 1)/2 = 2/2 = 1


It is true when:

Either a is even
Or b is even
Or their sum (a + b) is even



The reason for this is that natural number division rounds down. When both numbers give a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, you lose two halves in the separate divisions, but only one half in the combined division.
Would you like me to explain any part of these proofs in more detail? I can also show how to complete the omitted parts of the equivalence theorem if you're interested
